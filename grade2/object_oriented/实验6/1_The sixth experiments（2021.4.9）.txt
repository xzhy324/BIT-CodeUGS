1. Define CMyString class with demands as follows:
   1.1   The class, CMyString, can save any string which means an arbitary length;

   1.2   Overload operator+() to append string to another one;
  
   1.3   Overload operator-() to remove all characters or substring passed by arguments in a string;
 
   1.4   Overload operator<<() to print the string;

   1.5   Overload operator[]() to get or set a character.

   1.6   Define Find() member function to locate the first position of searching a character or a string;

   1.7   Define Mid() member function to get substring from one string;

   1.8   Define ToInt() member function to convert digital string to integer.

   1.9   Define ToDouble() member function to convert digital string to double.

   1.10  Define other member functions if you need.

   1.11  The client can use CMyString you defined like as in the main:

   void main()
   {
       CMyString s1("BIT"), s2;

       s2 = "love";
       s2[0] = 'L'
       cout << "I " + s2 + << " " << s1 << endl; // The output is:  I Love BIT


       int pos = s1.Find('T');                   // pos is 2, or -1 if  'T'  is not found.
       int pos = s1.Find("IT");                  // pos is 1, or -1 if  "IT"  is not found.


       CMyString S3("Here are some spaces in this string.");
       S1 = S3 - ' ';                            // Remove all spaces
       cout << 	S1 << endl;                      // The output is: Herearesomespacesinthisstring.


       CMyString str_num;
       str_num = 123;
       int a = str_num.ToInt();


       str_num = 123.456;
       double a = str_num.ToDouble();


       int a = 1, b = 2;
       CMyString my = s2.Mid(a, b); // a represents starting position, b represents the length of substring. So Mid can get a substring: ov.
   }

   NOTE: The type such as STRING and TEMPLATE in C++, and STRING LIBRARY in C and C++ are both FORBIDDEN in your program.
         The only one you can define is CHAR or CHAR* or CHAR&.




2. Define CInternetURL class to save a URL string like as "https://www.bit.edu.cn/xww/lgxb21/067aaa91b7524e7f9a43a5263633fcf4.htm"£¬
   and finish the demands as follows:

   2.1  Use CMyString you just finished before to save URL string£»

   2.2  Define member function getDomain() to get domain from URL. 
        For example, we can get   "www.bit.edu.cn"   from "https://www.bit.edu.cn/xww/lgxb21/067aaa91b7524e7f9a43a5263633fcf4.htm"£»

   2.3  Define member function getDomainCountry() to get country name in the domain from URL, such as "us", "uk", etc.
        For example, we can get  "cn" from "https://www.bit.edu.cn/xww/lgxb21/067aaa91b7524e7f9a43a5263633fcf4.htm"£»

   2.4  Define member function getDomainType() to get domain type from URL, such as "gov", "com", "org", and so on.
        For example, we can get  "edu"  from "https://www.bit.edu.cn/xww/lgxb21/067aaa91b7524e7f9a43a5263633fcf4.htm"£»

   2.5  The client can use CMyString you defined like as in the main:
        void main()
   	{
       		CInternetURL URL("https://www.bit.edu.cn/xww/lgxb21/067aaa91b7524e7f9a43a5263633fcf4.htm");
       		
       		cout << URL.GetDomain();         // The result is:  www.bit.edu.cn

       		cout << URL.GetDomainCountry();  // The result is:  cn

                cout << URL.GetDomainType();     // The result is:  edu
   	}

 NOTE: The type such as CHAR or CHAR* or CHAR& or STRING or TEMPLATE in C++, and STRING LIBRARY in C and C++ are both FORBIDDEN in your program.
       The only one you can define is CMyString or CMyString* or CMyString&.
